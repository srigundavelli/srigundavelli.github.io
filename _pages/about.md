I am a researcher at Cisco Systems working on enterprise wireless architecture and standards. I collaborate with teams across Cisco, IETF, Wireless Broadband Alliance, and the Wi-Fi Alliance on next generation wireless architectures.

I am part of Cisco’s Enterprise Wireless CTO team, where I drive innovation, lead standards efforts, and influence product and technology strategy. I co chair working groups in the Wireless Broadband Alliance, the Wi-Fi Alliance, and the IETF, helping advance wireless standards and building a better Internet.

I lead industry work on Wi-Fi Broadcast in both the Wi-Fi Alliance and the Wireless Broadband Alliance, including system architecture, use cases, and deployment models for broadcast delivery over Wi-Fi networks. 

A major focus of my current work is enabling mission critical services over Wi-Fi. This includes emergency calling, National Security and Emergency Preparedness services, and Public Warning and Emergency Alerts. I drive the architecture and industry alignment for these capabilities within the Wireless Broadband Alliance and am working to shape policy direction to enable emergency calling over Wi-Fi using native device dialers and manufacturer installed emergency Passpoint profiles.

I lead Wi-Fi and cellular convergence work in the Wireless Broadband Alliance, driving architecture to reduce handover latency between Wi-Fi and cellular through predictive vector roaming.

I hold more than 175 patents in mobile and wireless communications and have authored or co-authored over 29 IETF RFCs. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering.

Outside work, I enjoy long cycling rides.

My expertise is in Wi-Fi and Cellular technologies, with a strong focus on enterprise wireless architectures. Currently, I am part of Cisco's Enterprise Wireless CTO team, contributing to innovation and strategy in the wireless domain. Beyond Cisco, I co-chair three working groups (in WBA, in WFA  and at IETF), driving wireless standards.

I have been fortunate to be granted more than 150 patents in mobile communications and to publish over 25 IETF RFC standards. I enjoy collaborating with others to drive innovation and for building a better internet.

My current mission is to enable Wi-Fi to support mission-critical services (E-911, National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP), and Public Warning Systems) to realize greater access to emergency services and save lives in critical situations. 

Outside of work, I enjoy long cycling rides.

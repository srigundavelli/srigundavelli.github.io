I am a technologist at Cisco Systems driving innovation in enterprise wireless architecture and industry standards. I collaborate with teams across Cisco, the IETF, the Wireless Broadband Alliance, and the Wi-Fi Alliance on next generation wireless architectures.

I am part of Cisco’s Enterprise Wireless CTO team, where I drive innovation, lead standards efforts, and influence product and technology strategy. I co-chair working groups in the Wireless Broadband Alliance, the Wi-Fi Alliance, and the IETF, helping advance wireless standards and build a better Internet.

I am currently leading industry work on Wi-Fi Broadcast in the Wi-Fi Alliance and the Wireless Broadband Alliance, focused on system architecture, use cases, and deployment models for broadcast delivery over Wi-Fi networks.

One of my current goals is to enable mission critical services over Wi-Fi, including emergency calling, National Security and Emergency Preparedness services, and Public Warning and Emergency Alerts. I drive the architecture and industry alignment for these capabilities within the Wireless Broadband Alliance and am working to shape policy direction to support emergency calling over Wi-Fi using native device dialers and manufacturer-installed emergency Passpoint profiles. The objective is to deliver an experience consistent with emergency calling over cellular networks.

I am also driving Wi-Fi and cellular convergence work in the Wireless Broadband Alliance, focused on reducing handover-latency between Wi-Fi and cellular through predictive handovers that help avoid sticky client behavior using a network-assisted approach known as VectorRoaming.

I hold more than 180 patents in mobile and wireless communications and have authored or co-authored over 29 IETF RFCs. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering.

Outside work, I enjoy long cycling rides.
